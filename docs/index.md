# Driving Selenium from Dyalog APL

[Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org) is a widely used open-source tool for automating browsers, with growing support from browser vendors. The GitHub repository [Dyalog/Selenium](https://github.com/Dyalog/Selenium) contains code which allows Dyalog applications to drive browsers via Selenium.

The namespace Selenium contained in this repository contains cover-functions for some of the most frequently used features of Selenium. 
In contrast to earlier versions it is not neccessary to search for keep up with browsers versions etc. - using the latest Selenium features it is now possible to detect the locally installed browser (Chrome, Edge and Firefox are now supported!) and its version and get the appropriate driver automatically!
