{⍺}InitBrowser ⍵

The function InitBrowser takes a right argument which is a character vector indicating the name of the browser. If ⍵ is empty, the first found of Chrome, Firefox or Edge will be used. If the element is empty, the `Browser` element from `settings.json5` will be used and if that is also not available, we'll check the `DEFAULTBROWSER` variable in the Selenium namespace.
The optional left argument is a boolean indicating if we're re-initialising the browser - it saves the time required to setup of the NuGet components and simply re-initializes the browser driver. This can be useful when the browser was closed.
